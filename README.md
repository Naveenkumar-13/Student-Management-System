1. INTRODUCTION 
The Student Management System is a desktop application designed to manage 
student data such as names, roll numbers, courses, and marks. This project was 
built using Java Swing to create a user-friendly interface and uses object-oriented 
programming concepts for data management. 
The purpose of the system is to automate the manual work of maintaining 
student records and provide an efficient, reliable, and simple solution for schools 
or colleges to store and retrieve student information. 
 
2. OBJECTIVE 
• To design a desktop-based application to manage student records. 
• To allow operations like add, update, delete, view, and search student 
data. 
• To understand and apply Java Swing for GUI development. 
• To practice object-oriented design with real-world entities.
